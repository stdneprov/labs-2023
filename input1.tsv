9 w    It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen
19 p    Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind,
24 s    slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions,
36 q    though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.
48 k    The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats.
56 t    At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.
66 h    It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide:
78 v    the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features.
87 k    Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift.
99 m    Even at the best of times it was seldom working,
112 n    and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours.
124 g    It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week.
139 r    The flat was seven flights up, and Winston,
144 w    who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle,
150 h    went slowly, resting several times on the way.
161 y    On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall.
174 s    It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move.
179 y    BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.
187 p    Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures
193 u    which had something to do with the production of pig-iron.
206 v    The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror
214 j    which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall.
226 q    Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable.
237 k    The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed,
250 a    but there was no way of shutting it off completely.
