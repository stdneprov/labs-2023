56 t    It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen
152 x    Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind,
204 e    slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions,
4 n    though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.
144 p    The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats.
126 n    At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.
162 o    It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide:
230 s    the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features.
141 l    Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift.
128 b    Even at the best of times it was seldom working,
45 h    and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours.
29 x    It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week.
121 o    The flat was seven flights up, and Winston,
248 d    who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle,
95 b    went slowly, resting several times on the way.
142 c    On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall.
52 m    It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move.
191 h    BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.
239 y    Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures
36 d    which had something to do with the production of pig-iron.
222 t    The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror
34 h    which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall.
94 b    Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable.
1 l    The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed,
74 a    but there was no way of shutting it off completely.
