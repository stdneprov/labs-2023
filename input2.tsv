246 w    It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen
240 q    Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind,
230 v    slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions,
215 y    though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.
205 t    The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats.
196 o    At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.
188 f    It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide:
178 k    the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features.
170 h    Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift.
163 v    Even at the best of times it was seldom working,
150 o    and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours.
137 w    It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week.
130 k    The flat was seven flights up, and Winston,
116 k    who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle,
109 l    went slowly, resting several times on the way.
94 d    On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall.
82 x    It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move.
72 y    BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.
57 t    Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures
44 f    which had something to do with the production of pig-iron.
38 f    The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror
26 c    which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall.
13 q    Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable.
7 r    The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed,
2 f    but there was no way of shutting it off completely.
