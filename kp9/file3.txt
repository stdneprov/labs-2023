57 e    Bella: Now I'm afraid.
31 e    Everything about me invites you in.
32 f    My voice, my face, even my smell.
35 i    As if you could fight me off.
5 e    You don't go out in the sunlight.
27 a    I'm a killer.
24 x    (Edward walks into a sunbeam and he ... sparkles?)
40 n    Edward: I wanted to kill you.
64 l    Edward: What a sick, masochistic lion.
25 y    Bella: It's like diamonds. You're beautiful.
11 k    Edward: Say it. Out loud. Say it!
61 i    Edward: You don't know how long I've waited for you.
29 c    Edward: It's because you believe a lie. A camouflage.
12 l    Bella: Vampire.
17 q    (he takes her arm and leads her, walking fast) Where are we going?
42 p    Bella: I trust you.
14 n    Bella: No.
18 r    Edward: Up the mountain. Out of the cloud bank.
19 s    You need to know what I look like in the sunlight.
50 x    Like my own personal brand of heroin.
33 g    As if I would need any of that.
28 b    Bella: I don't believe that.
47 u    We've learned to control our thirst.
2 b    Your skin is pale white and ice cold.
45 s    Edward: My family, we're different than others of our kind.
10 j    Bella: I know what you are.
6 f    ... How old are you?
26 z    Edward: Beautiful? This is the skin of a killer, Bella.
1 a    Bella: You're impossibly fast, and strong.
15 o    Edward: Then ask me the most basic question: what do we eat?
38 l    Edward: I've killed people before.
51 y    Bella: Why did you hate me so much when we met?
54 b    Bella: I know you can.
20 t    (They fly. Sort of.)
34 h    As if you could out run me.
58 f    Edward: Good.
59 g    Bella: I'm not afraid of you, I'm only afraid of losing you.
30 d    I'm the world's most dangerous predator.
65 m    (They proceed to lie in a meadow and they boink! No, they stare at each other.)
9 i    Edward: A while.
41 o    I've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life.
36 j    (He shows off his powers.) I'm designed to kill.
52 z    Edward: I did. Only for making me want you so badly.
8 h    Bella: How long have you been seventeen?
44 r    Bella: I'm here. I trust you.
23 w    This is what I am.
3 c    Your eyes change color, and sometimes you speak like--like you're from a different time.
21 u    Edward: This is why we don't show ourselves in the sunlight.
62 j    And so the lion fell in love with the lamb.
63 k    Bella: What a stupid lamb.
4 d    You never eat or drink anything.
43 q    Edward: Don't.
66 n    Bella: (voice over) About three things I was absolutely positive:
55 c    Edward: I can't read your mind.
16 p    Bella: You won't hurt me.
67 o    first, Edward was a vampire.
13 m    Edward: Are you afraid?
68 p    Second, there was a part of him--and I didn't know how dominant that part might be--that thirsted for my blood.
22 v    People would know that we're different.
46 t    We only hunt animals.
49 w    It's like a drug to me.
48 v    It's you. Your scent.
39 m    Bella: It doesn't matter.
56 d    You have to tell me what you're thinking.
68 q    And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.
53 a    I still don't know if I can control myself.
37 k    Bella: I don't care.
7 g    Edward: Seventeen.
60 h    I feel like you're going to disappear.
